### Where I left off...

- Setting up example code:
- II think I need to change the structure to have both
  - Theme: Animal (this could be for)
  - What: Gopher (our What: )

### To  Do ðŸŸ¡âœ…

- âœ… Setup Desktop codebase
- âœ… Get basic function working
- âœ… Copy/paste into AI_lab as `openai_basic_server_client_hash_pages`
- ðŸŸ¡ OK! Time to Test Images!
  - fromt end api.js need to be refactered into dynamic.
  - add BASIC loader: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_loader.asp
  - Re org UI, move Test Image down and add input box rename button `Create Image`
  - After Card is created, reveal button to create image from object
    - Allow editing of object. 
  - Let's add `create_object_image` after you retreive an object it shows. 
  - Create new AI_Labs folder: `openai_image_object_client`
  - Add to Docs > https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage
  - Add that example to AI_Labs

- Write out raw UI outline for Character cards. 

### Checkpoints

- ðŸŸ¡ Local Stack Setup. Create `AI_Lab` Template(s).
- Tinker with Raw UI flow to create objects.
  - You wanna get to the point where you feel comfortable preping a UI. 

### MVP Breakdown

- Complete `README.md` for public (See palm-ai-api for example)
- Unordered todos...
  - Add an "X" to cancel... if possible?
  - Create Icon
  - Create loader: what about cards sifting from front to be animated? 


### MVP Overview

- Working Title: Card Creator AI
- 3x Themes with working examples
  - **Character Deck**: Built in back static image - click flips over to reveal. 
    - Example: Create a couple D&D like examples and generate a deck of ~50-100
  - **Flash Card**: Double sided theme, 2-click: meant to click reveal then click to discard. 
    - Example: question on front, answer on back. 
  - **Calendar**:Uses date to show D/M/Y and the content - click goes to previous day. 
    - Example: words of encouragement from Socrates. 
- Theme: let's keep this a little tighter. Color AI feels ... "Fuzzy" 

MVP + 

- Authenticate to save: firebase or search for other options. 
  - Like, maybe Do a GCD MERN.

## Future Posts Overview / POA

- âœ… OpenAI API: Getting started with **bare-bones** Node JS example.
- If we use card flip, or similar. Do a stand alone `lab/pages` example post.
