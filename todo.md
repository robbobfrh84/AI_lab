### Where I left off...

- Refactoring Example Code to be replaced in `Tut...`

### To  Do ðŸŸ¡âœ…
- Rather than config, use innerHTML of input boxes, so it's dynamic. You can probably remove the object from the _config. 
- Add to example Docs > https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage
- Write out raw UI outline for Character cards. 

### Checkpoints

- ðŸŸ¡ Local Stack Setup. Create `AI_Lab` Template(s).
- Tinker with Raw UI flow to create objects.
  - You wanna get to the point where you feel comfortable preping a UI. 
  - THOUGHT: II think I need to change the structure to have both...
    - Theme: Animal (this could be for)
    - What: Gopher (our What: )

### MVP Breakdown

- Complete `README.md` for public (See palm-ai-api for example)
- Unordered todos...
  - Add an "X" to cancel... if possible?
  - Create Icon
  - Create loader: what about cards sifting from front to be animated? 


### MVP Overview

- Working Title: Card Creator AI
- 3x Themes with working examples
  - **Character Deck**: Built in back static image - click flips over to reveal. 
    - Example: Create a couple D&D like examples and generate a deck of ~50-100
  - **Flash Card**: Double sided theme, 2-click: meant to click reveal then click to discard. 
    - Example: question on front, answer on back. 
  - **Calendar**:Uses date to show D/M/Y and the content - click goes to previous day. 
    - Example: words of encouragement from Socrates. 
- Theme: let's keep this a little tighter. Color AI feels ... "Fuzzy" 

MVP +

  - Like, maybe Do a GCD MERN.
