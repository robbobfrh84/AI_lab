### MVP Overview

- Working Title: Card Creator AI
- 3x Themes with working examples
  - **Character Deck**: Built in back static image - click flips over to reveal. 
    - Example: Create a couple D&D like examples and generate a deck of ~50-100
  - **Flash Card**: Double sided theme, 2-click: meant to click reveal then click to discard. 
    - Example: question on front, answer on back. 
  - **Calendar**:Uses date to show D/M/Y and the content - click goes to previous day. 
    - Example: words of encouragement from Socrates. 
- Theme: let's keep this a little tighter. Color AI feels ... "Fuzzy"
